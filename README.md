# USDC Transfer App

This is a sample application that allows users to transfer USDC tokens over a testnet network after connecting their wallet.

## Prerequisites

Before you can set up the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 12 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes bundled with Node.js)
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) (or any other compatible wallet extension)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/circle-ccooper/sample-usdc-transfer.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd sample-usdc-transfer
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Usage

1. **Connect your wallet**:

   When you first load the application, you'll be prompted to connect your wallet (e.g., Metamask) to the testnet network.

2. **Transfer USDC**:

   After connecting your wallet, you'll see a form where you can enter the amount of USDC you want to transfer and the recipient's address.

3. **Confirm the transaction**:

   When you click the "Send" button, your wallet will prompt you to confirm the transaction. Once the transaction is confirmed, you'll see a success message.
